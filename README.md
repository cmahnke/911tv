9/11 on TV
==========

You can see this code in action on the [web site](https://911tv.projektemacher.org).

# Why?

[11 September 2001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks) was not only an unprecedented terrorist attack, but also a special media event. The images have become iconic, of course, but also the density of events and length, mediated by live television coverage were without precedent.

I can still remember that day and the days that followed, how the event developed: first "just" a news ticker to a spectacular accident...
And further developments then led to more and more broadcasters taking up the unfolding events and accompanying it with special programmes.

The [impact of the event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks#Aftermath) is manifold. Besides the well-known global political, cultural ones, there are also social ones such as the [truther movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_truth_movement), which was certainly also fostered by contradictions and rumours in the context of the live coverage.

Of course, it is no longer possible today to recreate the reception situation of 9/11, if only because it is now known what happened and how it ended. But this page should at least be an attempt to recreate this situation and thus to create immersion. Contrary to current media usage habits, the television programme is linear, but you can change channels.

# How?

In 2007, the Internet Archive set up the [September 11 Television Archive](https://archive.org/details/sept_11_tv_archive), a collection of TV broadcasts from 20 channels over 7 days, totalling about 3000 hours of material. Although mainly US channels, it also includes some international channels such as [BBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC), [NTV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTV_(Russia)), [TV Azteca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Azteca), [MCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCM_(TV_channel)) and [CCTV-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCTV-3).

In addition, there is a [day view](https://archive.org/details/911), which is presented like an [EPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_program_guide), which allows a good overview, but unfortunately also prevents immersion, as it forces constant interaction.

Therefore, this website summarises the videos and presents them in a very reduced user interface: As an TV set.

Contrary to current media usage habits, the TV programme is linear, but you can change channels.
Key events can be displayed as teletext sub titles. Teletext can also be deactivated and the "TV" displayed in full-screen mode. Loading the teletext panels can take some time.
If errors occur, such as longer loading times or missing recordings, there is a picture disturbance. This also occurs when you try to switch off the television.

# About

9/11 on TV is a [Projektemacher](https://projektemacher.org/) project.

I had the idea about 10 years ago, around 2012, certainly around September, when I was regularly watching public domain films in the Internet Archive and stumbled across the 911 TV collection by chance. The initial idea was some sort of installation including a TV-Set, but the current web page is easier to implement.

## Movies

The Wikipedia has a [complete list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Films_based_on_the_September_11_attacks).

If your wondering, why Cloverfield is part of this list, it's because I consider it an metaphor for the 9/11 attacks, there is a section on this movie below.

* [United 93](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_93_(film)), 2006
* [World Trade Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center_(film)), 2006
* [Cloverfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloverfield), 2008
* [9/11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_(2017_film)), 2017

### Cloverfield

I consider [Cloverfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloverfield) to be one of the best movies related to the 9/11. Not because it's a realistic or accurate depiction of the attack on New York, but it'a masterpiece in capturing the but because it is a masterpiece to capture the mood and uncertainty subjectively.

The images of the subjective camera seem to be directly inspired by the live coverage of the time.  Interestingly, the film works on two levels: One observes the characters leading relatively normal lives and can thus identify with the protagonists. The film takes enough time to build up a corresponding mood before it get's more intense.

This forms the basis that allows the viewer to empathically experience the situation, which becomes more unclear in the course of the film, and the associated fears of the characters.

At the same time, the [found footage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Found_footage_(film_technique)) setting ensures that it is explicitly presented as a form of media reception.

And both the monster and the theme are of course a reference to [Godzilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godzilla) (although not necessarily in the [variant](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godzilla_(1998)) by [Roland Emmerich](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Emmerich)), who is an embodiment of the [atomic bombs dropped on Japan in 1945](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki).

All in all, a very impressive form of cinematic adaptation as a horror film (metaphor).

## Alternative Media

Even though it promotes [conspiracy theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_conspiracy_theories), the movie series [Loose Change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_Change) is noteworthy for illustrating cultural impact.

# Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

## Why is the sometimes static noise?

Getting the media files takes some time, this is called buffering. Since time progresses during buffering the application will show the TV set in a state equal to having no signal during buffering, this is especially the case when switching channels.

## Why is it impossible to rewind or forward the video?

To let the viewer experience the true horrors of linear television. üòâ
The main goal of this site is the immersion into the live coverage of that time, which includes the linear experience.

## Why does the site look so strange / ugly?

The page imitates a television set. It's called [skeuomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph), a common design philopsophy of the 90s, early 2000s, which is the time we are talking about here.
According to this philosophy, user interfaces should have be analogous to physical objects.

## The Teletext is hard to read, can it be changed?

No, this is intentional to shift (or better: force) the viewers attention of the viewer to the TV transmission and let them turn off the Teletext.

# Notes
## Technical data
* PAL resolution: 720 x 576
* NTSC resolution:720 x 480
* [Teletext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletext) has 25 rows with 40 columns
* The Teletext loop can be up to 30 sec long

## Teletext
The Wikipedia has an article on [Teletext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletext). There were several JavaScript libraries for Teletext under consideration:

* [@techandsoftware/teletext](https://bitbucket.org/rahardy/teletext/src/master/)
    There is a [whole family of packages](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40techandsoftware) with Teletext related software by the same author / company, which has been a great help developing the Teletext component.
* [teletext](https://github.com/andormade/teletext)

But since the Teletext functionality is only used to display some text, the teletext representation doesn't need to be 100% percent accurate.

There are several other interesting Teletext related sites, that might be interesting as well

* [Teletext for Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/ali1234/raspi-teletext)
* [Suite of tools for processing teletext signals recorded on VHS](https://github.com/ali1234/vhs-teletext)
* [The Teletext Archive](http://www.teletextarchive.com/)

## Static Noise

### Generating a static noise sound

```
ffmpeg -f lavfi -i 'anoisesrc=a=0.1:c=white' -t 10 output.mp3
```

A simple example using `ffmpeg`.

```
ffmpeg -f lavfi -i 'anoisesrc=a=0.1:c=white[s1];anoisesrc=a=0.2:c=pink[s2];[s1][s2]join[s1]' -map "[s1]"  -t 6  output.mp3
```
In stereo.

```
ffmpeg -f lavfi -i 'anoisesrc=a=0.1:c=white' -af 'apulsator=timing=hz:hz=.5:amount=.4' -ac 2 -t 6 output.mp3
```

With channel oscillation.

```
ffmpeg -f lavfi -i 'anoisesrc=a=0.1:c=white' -af 'tremolo=f=.5:d=.2' -ac 2 -t 6 output.mp3
```

Modulate along a sinus curve, like in the `TVStatic.jsx` canvas element.

```
ffmpeg -f lavfi -i 'anoisesrc=a=0.1:c=white' -af 'aphaser=type=s:speed=.5:decay=.25:in_gain=0.15:out_gain=0.6' -ac 2 -t 6 output.mp3
```

Another example with oscillation, see [`ffmpeg` documentation](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#aphaser) for more options. Make sure, that frequency and length end up.

```
ffmpeg -f lavfi -i 'anoisesrc=a=0.1:c=white[s1];[s1]tremolo=f=.5:d=.3[s1];[s1]apulsator=timing=hz:hz=.5:amount=.4' -ac 2 -t 8 output.mp3
```

It's also possible to combine effects, this was used to create the final effect.

## Converting images

Images that should be included in the videotext need some preprocessing. The requirements are described in the ['image-to-sextants' README](https://bitbucket.org/rahardy/image-to-sextants/src/main/README.md).

Short version: You need to resize to match the aspect ratio, the height should be less the 80px, if you want to keep a header ans footer,

```
convert site/src/assets/svg/cm.svg -size 70x70 -monochrome cm.png
```

## Development

### Generate required data

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
./scripts/setup.sh
```

### Installing dependencies

```
cd site
yarn install
```

### Starting the web server

```
cd site
yarn run vite
```

### Testing specific videos

There are several URL params that can be used to test specific videos:
* `c` - changes channel
* `r` - resets the time
* `t` - set a specific time

# TODO:

* Texts and links
  * Content
    * Finish 'Other resources'
    * More teletext pages from this document
* Video addressing
  * Seek - not tested yet, might be issues with gaps in coverage
  * Segmentation
    * Prefetch
  * Channel switching without loading
  * Handle (buffering) events
* Teletext
  * Check Colors in teletext graphics
* Testcard for gaps
* Reduce TODO's from code

## Known Issues
* Button's not scaling very well
* Powering on not working properly with test card
* Teletext: Graphic and Text clash
* Browser issues
  * Mobile browsers (portrait mode) not completely working yet, find a way to calculate aspect ratio.
* Clock gets out of sync / duplicated. Maybe after following link - certainly HMR related
* Data preprocessing
  * GLVSN does't seem to be working
  * Result of compressing `assets/json/*.json` using [JSONCrush](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/JSONCrush) isn't used
* Warnings
  * `react.development.js:209 Warning: forwardRef render functions do not support propTypes or defaultProps.`

## Further ideas

* Migrate to [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* Remove `r` and `t` from url after use - without triggering a rerender
* CRT effect, [see](https://babylonjs.medium.com/retro-crt-shader-a-post-processing-effect-study-1cb3f783afbc) and [Codepen](https://codepen.io/Mobius1/pen/zZpoXj)
* Check if video can be projected on a sphere using ThreeJS, see [WebGL examples](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=video#webgl_materials_video) or [VideoTexture](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/textures/VideoTexture)
* Bezel of TV set can be slimmer
* Electron App
* Data preprocessing
  * Multiple sub pages (manually split)
  * check if generated sub pages are needed
