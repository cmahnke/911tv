# About
 9/11 on TV is a [Projektemacher](https://projektemacher.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"} project.

I had the idea about 10 years ago, around 2012, when I was regularly watching public domain films in the Internet Archive and stumbled across the 911 TV collection by chance. The initial idea was some sort of installation including a TV-Set, but the current web page is easier to implement.

## Credits

The implementation of this project was only possible through the publication of the [digitised television recordings by the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/911){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}.
