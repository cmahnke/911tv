# Cloverfield 1

I consider [Cloverfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloverfield) to be one of the best movies related to the 9/11. Not because it's a realistic or accurate depiction of the attack on New York, but it'a masterpiece in capturing the but because it is a masterpiece to capture the mood and uncertainty subjectively.

The images of the subjective camera seem to be directly inspired by the live coverage of the time.  Interestingly, the film works on two levels: One observes the characters leading relatively normal lives and can thus identify with the protagonists. The film takes enough time to build up a corresponding mood before it get's more intense.
