# Cloverfield 2

This forms the basis that allows the viewer to empathically experience the situation, which becomes more unclear in the course of the film, and the associated fears of the characters.

At the same time, the [found footage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Found_footage_(film_technique)) setting ensures that it is explicitly presented as a form of media reception.

All in all, a very impressive form of cinematic adaptation as a horror film (metaphor).
