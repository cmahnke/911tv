Even though the [impact the attacs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks#Aftermath){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"} are manifold, this page focus on the "alternate" media part. This also also includes several [conspiracy theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_conspiracy_theories){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"} and the [truther movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_truth_movement){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}.

Which in turn either inspired or get incorporated into several other conspiracy theories / myths.

Notable media:
