# Teletext 1
The Wikipedia has an article on [Teletext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletext){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}. There were several JavaScript libraries for Teletext under consideration:

* [@techandsoftware/teletext](https://bitbucket.org/rahardy/teletext/src/master/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}
    There is a [whole family of packages](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40techandsoftware){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"} with Teletext related software by the same author / company, which has been a great help developing the Teletext component.
* [teletext](https://github.com/andormade/teletext){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}

But since the Teletext functionality is only used to display some text, the teletext representation doesn't need to be 100% percent accurate.
