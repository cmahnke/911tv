[11 September 2001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"} was not only an unprecedented terrorist attack, but also a special media event. The images have become iconic, of course, but also the density of events and length, mediated by live television coverage were without precedent.

I can still remember that day and the days that followed, how the event developed: first "just" a news ticker to a spectacular accident...
And further developments then led to more and more broadcasters taking up the unfolding events and accompanying it with special programmes.
