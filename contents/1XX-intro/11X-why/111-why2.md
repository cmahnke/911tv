The [impact of the event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks#Aftermath){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"} is manifold. Besides the well-known global political, cultural ones, there are also social ones such as the [truther movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_truth_movement){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}, which was certainly also fostered by contradictions and rumours in the context of the live coverage.

Of course, it is no longer possible today to recreate the reception situation of 9/11, if only because it is now known what happened and how it ended. But this page should at least be an attempt to recreate this situation and thus to create immersion. Contrary to current media usage habits, the television programme is linear, but you can change channels.
