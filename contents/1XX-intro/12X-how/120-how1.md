# How? - Part 1

In 2007, the Internet Archive set up the [September 11 Television Archive](https://archive.org/details/sept_11_tv_archive){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}, a collection of TV broadcasts from 20 channels over 7 days, totalling about 3000 hours of material. Although mainly US channels, it also includes some international channels such as [BBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}, [NTV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTV_(Russia)){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}, [TV Azteca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Azteca){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}, [MCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCM_(TV_channel)){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"} and [CCTV-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCTV-3){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}.

In addition, there is a [day view](https://archive.org/details/911){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}, which is presented like an [EPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_program_guide){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}, which allows a good overview, but unfortunately also prevents immersion, as it forces constant interaction.
